Instagram Automation Tool with Selenium
This is an open-source Instagram automation tool built with Selenium, enabling developers to automate interactions with Instagram through web scraping and browser automation.

How It Works:
The tool utilizes Selenium WebDriver to launch a web browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox), navigates to Instagram's website, logs in using provided credentials (ensure these are kept secure), and performs actions based on predefined rules. It is specifically designed for Instagram but it can be used for any websites and webapps just by modifying the placeholders!

Disclaimer:
This tool is intended for educational and research purposes. Use it responsibly and ensure compliance with Instagram's terms of service and legal requirements regarding automation.

Legal and Ethical Note:
Automating interactions with websites can have legal and ethical implications. Always obtain proper authorization and ensure your actions align with the terms of service of the targeted platform.
